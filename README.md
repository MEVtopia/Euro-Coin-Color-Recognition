# Euro Coin Color Recognition
A Python-based project that uses a trained dataset of Euro coin images to recognize the color of coins.

# Overview
The purpose of this project is to identify the color of Euro coins from images. Euro coins come in different colors:

Red coins: 1 cent, 2 cents, 5 cents
Yellow coins: 10 cents, 20 cents, 50 cents
1 Euro coin
2 Euro coin
By training on a dataset of these coins, the model aims to predict the color of a coin from a random set of images.

# Results

Coin Color Accuracy: The model correctly identifies the color of the coins with an accuracy of approximately 80.81%.
Coin Count Accuracy: The model correctly determines the number of coins in the image with an accuracy of approximately 84.31%.

# Usage

Clone the project, add your coin images on "Image traitement" and run the analysis of your choice.

# Dependencies

run "pip install -r requirements.txt"
